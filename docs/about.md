## How are we different from analytical teams?
**Do** – We develop and deploy data science products to make a positive impact on NHS patients and workforce. ​​

**Delve** - We investigate applying novel techniques that increase the insight we get from health-related data.​

**Distinguish** – We prioritise code-first ways of working, transparency and promoting best practice.  We champion quality, safety and ethics in the application of methods and use of data.  ​

**Distribute** – We have the remit to be open and collaborative and have the aim of sharing products with the wider healthcare community.
