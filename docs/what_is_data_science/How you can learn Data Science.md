# How you can learn Data Science

Data Science isn't just for Data Scientists! As a profession, we're passionate about sharing these skills and techniques.

The [NHS Data Science community](https://data-science-community.analystx.uk/) is the home of spreading data science knowledge within the NHS.

You can also learn lot about data science by simply getting to know the wider cross-government/health community:

- [Govt Data Science Community](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/data-science-community)
- [NHS R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/)
- [NHS Pycom](https://nhs-pycom.net/)
- [AnalystX](https://analystx.uk/)

These have some overlap, but each has it's own niche, depending on what language or area you want to focus more on (e.g. Python, R, specific use cases).
